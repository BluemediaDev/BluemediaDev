## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Oliver, a sysadmin and open-source enthusiast.

Whether as an admin at my main job, at events of the Chaos Computer Club, or with my [own AS in the DN42 network](https://dn42.bluemedia.dev): I do a lot of stuff with technology. And I'm always curious to discover even more. Using that knowledge I try to create something valuable for myself and others. Whether it is a small project of my own, or a contribution to a larger project.

Feel free to look around in my repositories, you might even find something useful for you!

## Facts, facts, more facts!
