## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
I'm Oliver - sysadmin and open-source enthusiast. I like to dive into new technologies and try to use my learned skills to create something helpful for myself and others.

Whether as an admin at my main job, at events of the Chaos Computer Club, or with my own AS in the DN42 network. I do lots of stuff with technology, all in all I'm a pretty geeky guy ðŸ¤“

Feel free to look around in my repositories, you might even find something useful for you!

## Facts, facts, more facts!
